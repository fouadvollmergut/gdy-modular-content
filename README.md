# GDY Modular Content

### Create and edit modular content from the frontend of your wordpress site.

This plugin allows you to create modular content and to edit it with a intuitive user interface from the frontent of your site. Main philosophy of the plugin is it to make it easy for all of you. That means easy handling for editors, fast and flexible implementation for programmers and good control over your layouts for designers. The plugin should run in most enviroments because it uses pretty much the native WordPress architecture to save contents (postmeta, attachments). So far no lasting problems with any other plugins are reported.
